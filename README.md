### How to Run

```shell
$ gulp                          # or, `gulp --release`
```

This will start a lightweight development server with LiveReload and
synchronized browsing across multiple devices and browsers.

### How to Deploy

```shell
$ gulp deploy                   # or, `gulp deploy --production`
```

You can deploy to different destinations by adding a corresponding flag.
For example `--production` or `--staging` etc. See the 'deploy' task in
`gulpfile.js`.
